All group members were present and contributing during all work on this project. 


1. We used curvature and bounding box area as extra features.
2. Continuous.
3. No thresholds are needed for continuous feature.
4. Without the extra features, the accuracy is 275/495=56%.
   With the extra features, the accuracy is 330/495=67%.
   Although the improvement of performance is not significant, itâ€™s also nontrivial.
5. We used all files for both training and testing.
   Confusion matrix for the naive classifier:
   {'text': {'text': 0, 'drawing': 220}, 'drawing': {'text': 0, 'drawing': 275}}
   Confusion matrix for the improved classifier:
   {'text': {'text': 220, 'drawing': 0}, 'drawing': {'text': 165, 'drawing': 110}}
